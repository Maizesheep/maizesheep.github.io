		<p> My name is maizesheep. Obviously it's not my name in real life,
		but this is the internet, and privacy is important to me. "But maize,
		how can you write an about me without sharing private information?"
		This may be a question of yours. My answer to it is that I will say things
		that can be found out from my username alone. I speak a few languages (how
		else would I translate a toki pona course to another language) and I like music.
		I like a lot of music actually, and it's quite possible that at some point you'll
		see a music tab full of my recs in pop-rock-metal (imagine it's a spectrum and 
		we're tracing a line along it) as well as some music from around the world that
		I heavily enjoy. I refuse to listen to English-language and Western Pop alone,
		so be on the lookout for some music from other traditions. Also, I make music.
		Performing and composing are both fun. Producing too. So, you may see that
		appear in future, in addition to whatever future projects I may decide to add. Thanks 
		for reading, and feel free to leave if you've read the whole site. Don't worry, I won't know.

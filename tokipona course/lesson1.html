            <p>
            If you're here, I assume you know what
            toki pona is and how it's a minimalistic conlang published by 
            Canadian linguist Sonja Lang in 2001. If you didn't already know,
            please find out more from the toki pona website <a href="https://tokipona.org">tokipona.org</a>
            </p>

            First, let's start with phonology. These are the sounds in a language.
            There are 14 sounds in toki pona, and, conveniently, 14 letters!<br>
            These letters are exactly like in English: m, n, s, w<br>
            The other consonants aren't too difficult, you just need to get yourself used to them.
            p, t, k are not as strongly pronounced as they are in English (they're <em>unaspirated</em>
            as linguists would call them). Basically, pronounce them without the puff of air and you'll
            be golden.<br>
            The l, unlike in most dialects (with a notable exception being Irish dialects), is a light l.
            What does this mean? It means that you need to get rid of that knot in the back of your throat 
            when you say your typical English l sound.<br>
            The j is the one that is most likely to trip you up and have people misunderstanding you 
            if you mispronounce it. The j simply sounds like a y at the beginning of words does in English, 
            not like the j in judge or juice or jazz. Treat it like a y, it'll make your life easier.

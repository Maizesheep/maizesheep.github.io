			<h2>what is YiddishQ?</h2>
				<p>YiddishQ is a set of (un-unified, I can work
				on that but nobody uses them so I'll wait for complaints)
				phonetic Yiddish keyboards I made out of boredom, while I
				was first learning Yiddish. Also, you may be asking what 
				a phonetic keyboard is. Well, as far as I understand, a 
				phonetic keyboard is a keyboard that uses a QWERTY or QWERTZ or AZERTY 
				or whatever latin layout that is transliterated. That is to say, the 
				Arabic 101 and 102 keyboards are not phonetic keyboards, but YiddishQ is, 
				to a degree anyway.<br><br>
				
				I created YiddishQ to solve the issue of the Hebrew layout. 
				I find the Hebrew layout difficult to remember, and frankly, useless for me, 
				a person whose only goal was to learn Yiddish, not Hebrew. Unfortunately, 
				(that was my bad, whoops) the YiddishQ keyboards are not exactly the 
				same across platforms but they're similar enough that I'm comfortable 
				calling them all by the same name. I'm going to walk you through them.
				
				<br><br>
				Before we start, I'd like to thank Isaac Bleaman for his Yiddish Klal keyboard, 
				vatnid for their raw MacOS keyboard file (I don't have a Mac to edit), 
				Daniel O'Donnell for information on how to edit the Linux file, and 
				roelandmoors for the xml file. I'm going to link each of their projects right 
				here because their work made YiddishQ possible.<br><br>

				<h2><a href="https://github.com/Maizesheep/Yiddish-Modified-QWERTY-Keyboard-for-Windows-10-11">YiddishQ for Windows</a></h2>
				<img src="images/keyboard-layout.png" alt="Windows Yiddish Q keyboard">
				<p>This is the original YiddishQ keyboard. I made this keyboard for personal
				use and it's most practical for me specfically. The download for this project is 
				listed on Github, but it can be easily edited with the 
				<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134">Microsoft Keyboard Creator</a>.
				What are my criticisms with how I made this? Well, if I remember correctly, 
				I did not make the singular characters typeable on the keyboard, only the combined characters 
				like ײַ (<i>pasekh tsvey yudn</i>) and not having ײַ as its precomposed form.
				If I remember correctly, I did that for all the Hebrew characters as well, such as dotted ones 
				and אַ/אַ (<i>pasekh alef</i>), for example. Though in some fonts, this does look worse, it 
				is not a big issue because I've found that in those fonts, precomposed characters might
				end up in a different font or they just don't render. That's completely anecdotal though, 
				and I recommend that if you modify this keyboard, you change the shifted forms of the 
				characters to make them precomposed. I also recommend adding niqqud with the alt key.

				<p>
				This was the next endeavor. This is definitely the best out of the bunch. You can type in the latin 
				alphabet too! Just, only in all caps. I assume, anyway. I have not been able to test this, because I 
				do not own a Mac and I only coded it with text alone. Also, this keyboard layout image is color-coded, 
				so you can easily figure out what buttons to press (again, assuming it works). If it doesn't, please fix 
				it thanks.

				<img src="images/keyboard-layout-linux.jpg" alt="Linux Yiddish Q keyboard">
				<p>The issue with the Linux version is that Linux only accepts keys as precomposed characters. 
				In hindsight, I could've just added niqqud as alt characters, but I could barely figure out how 
				to do what I did so I'll probably just wait around until someone complains. Good luck installing 
				this one, I've never seen a Linux-running machine in real life before, so I cannot help you. Have fun!

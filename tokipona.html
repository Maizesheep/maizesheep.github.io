			<h2>what is toki pona?</h2>
			<p>
				toki pona is a language that is quite personal to me.
				It has been a big part of my conlanging journey and my 
				foray into linguistics. It has also impacted my philosophy 
				in a way, as I think since initially learning some toki pona, 
				I've been better at simplifying my thoughts and 
				breaking down my beliefs. I've also become less materialistic 
				I feel, but that could be for other reasons.<br><br>

				Oh, and by the way the official website is <a href="https://tokipona.org">tokipona.org</a>
			</p>
			<h2>linja Mesipi lon lipu</h2>
			<p>
				I made a handwritten font with <a href="https://wasokeli.github.io/sp-font-maker/">wasokeli's font maker</a>!
				You can download it here: <a href="/images/linja-Mesipi-lon-lipu-Regular.ttf" download>linja Mesipi lon lipu</a>.
				I might update it in the future, maybe by adding long pi and other extendable glyphs (which the sp font maker 
				currently does not support, but it can be added manually). Also, don't worry, it's under the 
				<a href="https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/">OFL license</a>, not 
				"All rights reserved" or anything. I don't need anyone protecting the copyright on this.
				I also made a 16px wide font with fontstruct and fontforge (and some of wasokeli's code)
				but I don't know if I can apply the OFL because of fonstruct's license, so I'll keep it to myself.

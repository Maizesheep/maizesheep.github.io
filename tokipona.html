			<h2>what is toki pona?</h2>
			<p>
				toki pona is a language that is quite personal to me.
				It has been a big part of my conlanging journey and my 
				foray into linguistics. It has also impacted my philosophy 
				in a way, as I think since initially learning some toki pona, 
				I've been better at simplifying my thoughts and 
				breaking down my beliefs. I've also become less materialistic 
				I feel, but that could be for other reasons.
